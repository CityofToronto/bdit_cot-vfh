      "section0": "PTC trips have grown by 180% in 2.5 years",
      "section0-text1": "PTC trips have grown rapidly since the service was first licensed by the City in September 2016, increasing to 176,000 daily trips in March 2019 &ndash; an increase of over 180%. Most of these trips were made in the district of Toronto and East York, which in September 2018 accounted for 61% of the total number of daily trips, followed by North York (16%), Etobicoke York (13), and Scarborough (9%).",
      "growthtsTitle": "Average daily PTC Trips, September 2016 &ndash; March 2019",

      "section4-text1b": "In Etobicoke North, during the Monday morning peak (7:00&ndash;9:00), <a href='#' class='hover-link highlight-humber' data-highlight='simPop'>a considerable number of drop-offs were made at Humber College</a> near the bus terminal compared with the number of pick-ups (212 vs. 24, respectively, or 89%). Most of these drop-offs arrived from the same ward (647 out of 1370, or 47%), followed by Etobicoke Centre (142, or 10%), Humber River-Black Creek (120, or 9%), Etobicoke-Lakeshore (111, or 8%). So, many people who live near Humber College use PTCs to get to school in the mornings.",
      "section4-text1c": "In the suburbs, trips are more commuter-focused, since their Friday night and weekend profiles are smaller compared with the city average which is dominated by downtown activity. For example, selecting Scarborough-Agincourt from the dropdown menu shows that there are strong peaks on weekday mornings and reduced Friday/Saturday night activity compared with the city average. Moving the cursor over the Monday morning peak shows on the adjacent map several drop-off locations (pink circles) around Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the Hollands Broadview Rehabilliation Hospital, whereas on Friday or Saturday evening the dropoffs (purple circles) clustered around the Don Mills entertainment complex."
